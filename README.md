FACE  UNLOCK PROJECT

OBJECTIVE:
      The objective of the model need to develop deep learning model that will recognize the person face using webcam.
      
      
Description:
* I have developed deep learning model.model name is facenet.facenet is a pretrained model.FaceNet is a face recognition pipeline that learns mapping from faces to a position in a multidimensional space where the distance between points directly correspond to a measure of face similarity.
* facenet model will stores the vector of the person face features.then all the vectors stored in FAISS library.
* FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library that allows developers to quickly search for embeddings of multimedia documents that are similar to each other. It solves limitations of traditional query search engines that are optimized for hash-based searches, and provides more scalable similarity search functions.
* other face recognition pretrained model:
1.Facenet
2.VGG face
3.Siamese Network
